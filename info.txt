In this emulator, the display instruction (DXYN) is completed for you,
and it is your task to fill out the others!

Some sample programs are included in the /programs directory.
In order to run the IBM logo program, you need to complete these instructions:

1NNN: Jump to instruction
6XNN: Set register VX to NN
7XNN: Add NN to VX (without changing carry bit)
ANNN: Set index register to NNN

The functionality for these instructions are in cpu.c
